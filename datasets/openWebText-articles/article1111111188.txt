CONCORD, N.H. — The entrepreneur Andrew Yang’s presidential campaign said Thursday that he had raised more than $16.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a considerable sum that represents his best total for a three-month period to date and is likely to put him among the Democratic field’s top five fund-raisers.
The $16.5 million raised from October to December eclipses the $9.9 million Mr. Yang’s campaign raised during the previous quarter and is more than five times what it brought in the quarter before that. But even as Mr. Yang improves his fund-raising, with about a month remaining before the Iowa caucuses, he is still seeking a last-minute boost in the polls that would allow him to qualify for the Democratic debate later this month.
Over the course of the campaign, aides said, Mr. Yang has received donations from about 400,000 people who have collectively given more than one million total contributions. The average donation to the campaign has been around $30, and 98 percent of online donations have been $200 or less, Mr. Yang’s campaign said.
