Hypocrisy was at its worst on Friday as liberals, leftists, and Democrat apparatchiks exploded in a paroxysm of hatred toward America, our values, our troops, our allies, and our president upon the announcement that Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani had been killed in a U.S. drone strike. The cowardly, lying, bullying hypocrites of the left predictably could not stand anything that this president does, even when it is meant to protect them, their families, and all Americans. Even a CNN military analyst, Major Gen. James A. "Spider" Marks (ret.), attempted to calm the raging lunatics, who appeared to have forgotten that their messiah, BHO, ordered the killing of OBL on his watch...a similar act (and probably the only significant achievement of his miserable, failed presidency).
Trump Derangement Syndrome has clearly metastasized into permanent Trump Dementia. Each achievement by Republicans is met with greater and greater hostility from the institutionally hypocritical left, never mind the facts or the truth. Laws go by the wayside, and due process is ignored...any action is permissible, no matter how unlawful or appalling, if the goal is for Democrats to gain power. This sort of boundless stupidity serves only to expand and reinforce Trump's support and add many more donations to his 2020 re-election campaign.
