National Population Register, 2010 was conducted in a few states and not all, and at a time when there was no controversy about NRC and without the unhappy experience of the Assam NRC, pointed out former Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram on Monday. There was no CAA looming large either, he added.
What’s more, NPR 2010 gathered data in respect of only 15 fields. On the contrary, NPR 2020 will be conducted all over the country; it will be done in the background of the disastrous experience of the Assam NRC and the discriminatory CAA; and the form that will be used in NPR 2020 will have many additional fileds—all mischievous and irrelevant to a Census, the former union minister pointed out.
NPR 2020, he said, will ask for information on the last place of residence, the place of birth of the parents, voter identity, passport number, driver’s licence, PAN and Aadhaar.
