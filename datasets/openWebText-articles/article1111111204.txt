Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields announced Friday all police vehicles will no longer chase suspects in the city.
"We've had a restrictive pursuit policy for many years," Shields said Friday.
She went on to say the risk/reward of pursuing suspects in vehicles is not worthwhile and, as chief, Shields would rather err on the side of safety.
"I feel we need to step back and make the policy more restrictive," she said. "By that I mean allowing but for a select number of highly trained individuals to chase at all."
