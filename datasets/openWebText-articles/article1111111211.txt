To the Offices of the Prime Minister and Speaker, of the House of Commons and the Government of the United Kingdom; Mr Boris Johnson and Sir Lindsay Hoyle
Now that the Fog of Brexit is starting to clear; The People of Scotland, feel it is necessary to once again take to the booths in a public referendum, to decide if Scotland shall follow the rest of the UK with its decision to take itself out of the EU. Or if Scotland will make its final informed choice on moving on from our Union with the UK, voting to leave and reclaiming our Independence as the Nation of Scotland and claim responsibility for our own successes, failures and fates.
The Scottish People have a right to self determination in our ongoing relationship with the rest of the UK. In 2014 we voted to remain in the UK on the promises of The Better together Campaign headed by then Prime Minister, David Cameron; that if Scotland voted to remain in the UK, the UK would not be leaving the EU.
As the terms for Scotlands Choice to remain in the UK have changed; We hereby request our right to re-evaluate our place in the UK, now that the state of the union is much more clear and a state that was against our clearly expressed wishes. Any reasonable person would grant another's right to re-evaluate a relationship, once the nature of it is changing against a persons will.
