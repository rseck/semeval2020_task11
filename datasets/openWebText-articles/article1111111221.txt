FILE – In this Feb. 16, 2016 file photo Deputy National Security Adviser For Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes speaks in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington. An advocacy group recently identified by the White House as part of its echo chamber gave National Public Radio $100,000 to help it report on the Iran nuclear program and related issues. It also funded reporters at The Nation and fellow liberal media outlet Mother Jones, and partnered with the Center for Public Integrity.

A great mourning has set in among former Obama administration officials.
After spending years appeasing Iran, only to have their regional violence grow stronger, Iran’s top general and terrorist leader Qassem Soleimani is dead. The Obama administration (like the Bush administration), passed on taking him out many times in the name of promoting “peace.” This allowed Soleimani to continue to run roughshod over places like Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon, where Iranian backed militias have killed tens of thousands, including hundreds of U.S. troops. It wouldn’t even be an overstatement to say the chaos he’s sown has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths.
Despite the reality of how great his death is for the world, especially those residing in the Middle East under his thumb, the Obama Bros are here to attempt to cover for their past failures. Here’s former van driver Tommy Vietor.
Strikes on KH targets led to the breach of our embassy in Baghdad. If the US did this, the response from Iran will likely be exponentially greater. Is there a plan to keep our personnel in the region safe? Soleimani is a pos but this seems insane. https://t.co/Sqj0FjNLez — Tommy Vietor (@TVietor08) January 3, 2020
He might as well be broadcasting for Tehran. The strike on our embassy, which failed and ended with zero casualties, was not the first blow in this engagement. Iranian backed militias, led by Soleimani, had killed an American contractor the week prior in a rocket attack on a U.S. base. Before that, Iran had recently seized shipping, shot down drones, and generally crossed several lines in the face of Trump’s patience. That patience ran out. It is not our fault that Iran continues to be an aggressor, but it was our solution to take out a terrorist who was behind much of the violence.
Failed novelist Ben Rhodes also chimed in with this rant.
Serious contradiction that the justification for the strike was stopping attacks on US personnel, and the strike itself raises the risk of attacks. We need a clear explanation of the objectives and strategy. https://t.co/x8CgHPANOa — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) January 3, 2020
Congress has to assert itself and determine exactly what our Iran policy is. Did we mean to do this? Do we have any plan for what comes next? What is the legal basis for all this? — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) January 3, 2020
Does anyone think Donald Trump is equipped to handle a complex, enduring, international crisis that could play out in many countries and demand expertise, rigorous process, and judicious decision-making? — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) January 3, 2020
If you read Rhodes’ feed, even before Soleimani’s death, it was basically a mouthpiece for the Mullahs. He’s been repeating one-sided talking points for most of Trump’s presidency, apparently angered that the current administration isn’t kowtowing to the Iranian regime.
Of all the people who should sit down for this one, it’s Rhodes, who helped orchestrate one of the most disastrous, deadly foreign policies in American history (without a world war going on). Over half a million people are dead in Syria because of Rhodes’ strategy there. Libya is currently a terrorist hotbed because of Rhodes. Iran was emboldened, killing thousands in Iraq, including U.S. soldiers because of Rhodes’ push to appease them.
The Obama administration’s foreign policy leaders, whether it be Vietor, Powers, Rice, Rhodes, or anyone else, showed us what total failure looks like.
I’m no foreign policy expert so I just look at what Ben Rhodes and Samantha Power say and think the exact opposite. — Julie Kelly (@julie_kelly2) January 3, 2020
It’s pretty scary in hindsight to think that these people were in charge of the most important decisions in American policy. It’s easy to look back on the Obama administration and sometimes think “that wasn’t so bad.” Sure, it wasn’t as far-left as the current Democrat party, but it was absolutely “that bad,” and we should be thankful there are people in charge today who actually support American interests instead of Iran’s.
