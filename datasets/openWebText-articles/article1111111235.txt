In the 1960s, Canadians were deeply affected by the civil rights and anti-war struggles, and the government took major steps to be recognized as an independent and united country. The country didn’t have a national flag; newly elected Prime Minister Lester B. decided that the country must have its own flag. After lengthy debates and a lot of protests in the streets, the current leaf flag was adopted from 5,900 designs. In 1967, the World’s Fair was held in Montreal, Quebec, coinciding with the first Canadian Centennial. By the mid-1960s, more than half of Canada’s population of 20 million was under the age of 25. The baby boom started slowing in the late 1950s, but it would take until the 1980s before it would finish growing up. These amazing color photos show cities, streets, roads, landmarks, and the everyday life of Canadian people in the 1960s.
