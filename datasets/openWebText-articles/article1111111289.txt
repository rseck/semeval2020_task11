Inter Milan have won the race to sign Tottenham star Christian Eriksen this month, according to reports in Denmark.
The Danish playmaker has six months left on his current Spurs deal which has prompted the likes of Manchester United, PSG and Juventus to bid for his signature.
However, Danish media outlet Ekstra Bladet are reporting that Inter will pay Tottenham Â£20million in January to beat their rivals to the punch.

The 27-year-old wants to leave for a new challenge and can now negotiate with clubs from outside of England if he chooses to seek a deal to leave Spurs for free in the summer.
'I feel that I am at a place in my career where I might want to try something new,' Eriksen announced earlier this summer after Tottenham's Champions League final defeat to Liverpool.
'I have the wildest and deepest respect for everything that has happened in Tottenham, nor will it be negative. But I have also said that I would like to try something new.'
Manchester United, PSG and Juventus have all expressed an interest in the Danish midfielder
While he is almost certain to leave, Eriksen has managed to work his way back into Jose Mourinho's plans at Tottenham, starting their last two games.
And the Portuguese manager has previously admitted he knows what Eriksen's outlook going forward is.
Earlier this week, he said: 'I think I know his future because his communication with me is completely open and honest and we trust each other.
'The only thing I can tell you is that I know his future but I am not going to be the one to speak about his future.
'It has to be him to speak about his future when he makes the decision to speak about his future, not me.'
