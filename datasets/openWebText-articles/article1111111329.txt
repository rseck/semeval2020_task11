Amazon is the largest retailer in the world. We are all happy and grateful to have them especially when you don’t have the time or patience to go around shopping all the things you need. But unfortunately every time you order, tons of single use plastic arrives with your products.
Let’s ask the company to reduce the amount of plastic used and avoid it when it is not necessary.
Let’s ask them to stop using the plastic, bubble bags and switch to more eco friendly solutions.
We cannot afford to keep polluting our planet at this rate and everyone but specially large corporations have the moral obligation to lead by example.
