Around 250 million workers are on strike today in India, the largest such strike in the country's history. The strike has been called by 10 central trade unions and a number of workers' organisations. Farmers' organisations and movements, as well as students' organisations, have joined the mobilisation.
Across the country, workers are taking out marches against the economic policies of the Modi government. Some of the key issues are the soaring unemployment, the economic crisis, the government's blatant bid to weaken labour laws and the disinvestment of PSUs across the country. The workers are also protesting the divisive Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.
Workers across all sections of the economy - from banks, telecom firms and the IT sector to small manufacturing units - are participating in the strike. We bring you the latest updates
