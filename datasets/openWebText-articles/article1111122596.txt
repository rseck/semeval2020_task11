Mogo, a town on the NSW south coast has been devastated by bushfires earlier. Grant, managed to save his property along the Princess Highway. After saving his place, he moved onto his elderly neighbours place to save it. It became too late and he was engulfed in flames. He drove back towards his place, which neighbours a dam, but amongst the blinding smoke, ran off the road into a tree. He then left the car and jumped into his dam for safety. His car was destroyed.
