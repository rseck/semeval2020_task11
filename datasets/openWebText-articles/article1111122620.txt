I have no claim on the characters or anything from GROWN UPS. But you could’ve figured that out.
I wrote this as a celebration. It should be pretty clear that I love these movies and the SandlerVerse after reading this, even though I love to poke fun at all of it.
Read it and have fun and maybe if it isn’t possible for this script to provide the template for GROWN UPS 3, there’s always GROWN UPS 4…
