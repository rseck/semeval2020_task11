"He'll juke you," safety Kenny Vaccaro said of Jackson. "You just have to get multiple guys around him. Any time you try to do a kill shot you'll probably get juked off the screen ... and end up on The Checkdown on Instagram. You don't want to end up on the highlight reels or on 'C'Mon Man!' or something like that. So you have to be able to breakdown, be a sound tackler, keep your eyes up and keep moving. You just have to play hard, play fast and be physical."
