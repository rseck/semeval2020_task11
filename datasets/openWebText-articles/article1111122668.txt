Ten years. They said it was too long. Ten years worth of video games? A full decade of highs and lows, seachanges and treechanges, memories and moments. A full decade’s worth of video games talk. They said it was too long. So we shortened it to around an hour and fifty minutes. Please enjoy Tommy, Ben and Adam being possibly the last piece of video game related media to get around to a 2010’s recap as we go through our favourite games and significant trends of the just passed decade here in part one of our two part recap. Woppa Gangnam Style indeed, 2010s. Woppa Gangnam Style indeed.
