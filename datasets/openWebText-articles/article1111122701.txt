Biden certainly has softened his stance on Iran since he decided to run for president.
It is so sad that we cannot even be united against a murderous terrorist. It is shameless that the Democrats are dividing the nation for political gain.
Heaven forbid they ever give Trump credit for anything.
Here is no malarkey Joe in 1996. The key part happens around the 1:20 mark.
In this clip, Biden says that Iran attacking U.S. service members would be “an act of war” and that by doing so “they yield their sovereignty”. Biden further goes on to state that by doing so the United States “can take whatever action it deems appropriate”.
Joe claims that us executing JUSTICE on this terrorist will cause Iran to ramp up nuclear enrichment.
He hilariously claims that the Obama administration had solved the Iranian problem.
If they solved it, why were they there in Iraq targeting the American embassy? Is he kidding?
To his credit, Joe admits Soleimani killed many troops and was a very bad guy who deserved to be “brought to justice for his crimes”.
However, he stops short of saying Trump did the right thing saying that Soleimani “was a senior figure of the Iranian government”. Sounds to me like Biden knows it was the right thing but is just SCARED of Iran and scared of giving credit where it’s due.
At least Biden, as of yet, has not questioned President Trump’s authority to act or called it an “assassination” like Elizabeth Warren and crazy Bernie.
