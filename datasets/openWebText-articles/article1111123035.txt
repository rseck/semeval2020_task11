Growing up in Sweden, he was noticed by Atalanta, who then inserted him into their youth sector. Last season, he played on four occasions in Serie A.
But it is in the current season where the spotlight turned on Dejan, who on loan to Parma, has stood out for his technical skills, vision of the game and physicality. Stats-wise: in September he scored his first goal, against Turin (a game in which he also got an assist). In total, he made 17 appearances and scored four goals in Serie A. Heâ€™s also made two appearances in the Coppa Italia.
