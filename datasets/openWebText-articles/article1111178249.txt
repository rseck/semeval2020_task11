A New Zealand penguin who had its leg amputated after it got stuck in a fishing line in 2007 is getting a brand new 3D printed one.
When the Little Blue Penguin was brought to the Christchurch Antarctic Centre nine years ago his foot had to be amputated and it has been limping ever since. Now Bagpipes is being fitted with new 3D printed prototypes in a New Zealand first.
Mal Hackett, a penguin keeper at the Antarctic Centre, said that Bagpipes often got pressure wounds on the bottom of his stump, so the foot would help take the weight off.
