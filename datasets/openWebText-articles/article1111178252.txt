TESCO has withdrawn a camping chair featuring the Northern Ireland flag from all its stores in the north.
The fold-up chair, released ahead of the European Championships, has been withdrawn as it "didn't meet technical standards" - despite similar chairs featuring the Irish tricolour, Welsh dragon and English flag remaining available to buy on the company's website.
Tesco would not say whether their decision to remove the product in stores and online was due to complaints.
Mid-Ulster UUP councillor Trevor Wilson said the chair was put on sale in the Cookstown superstore in the Orritor Road Retail Park at 10am before being taken off the shelves at 10.30am.
The Tyrone Courier reported that the Northern Ireland chair was available in Tesco's Dungannon store at Beechvalley last Thursday morning, but were removed from the shelves in the afternoon due to what a store representative called an "emergency recall".
Mr Wilson said the decision to remove the chairs "beggars belief". "It is a disgrace, actually disgrace is an understatement," he said.
Tesco said the camping chair was "safe to use," but "didn't meet our technical standards" and has been withdrawn from all stores in Northern Ireland where it was on sale.
He confirmed that other items including a t-shirt and a football which feature the Northern Ireland flag are available for purchase at stores in the north.
"Our whole business is gearing up to support the home nations this summer and we will have a number of great offers and products for customers. Unfortunately there was a technical problem with a product in Northern Ireland, meaning it has been withdrawn. We are working on a replacement," the spokesman added.
