Recently it was revealed that SEGA will be attending E3 this year. SEGA had pulled out of last year’s E3 event to focus on relocating their company to Southern California.
In a press release, SEGA has teased a few games for their E3 lineup this year. Oddly enough, Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games is not listed, but it’s possible Nintendo will showcase the game instead.
Fear not, here are the other titles confirmed to be at the show:
Unfortunately there’s no new news about a 25th anniversary Sonic game, but thankfully Sonic Boom: Fire & Ice will be there to play. Sonic Boom: Fire & Ice will be the first Sonic game released for consoles since 2014’s Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal. This will be the first Sonic Boom game on the 3DS where Amy is a playable character as well.
Select media can also check out a closed door presentation of Warhammer; 40.000 Dawn of War III. This will be the first E3 presentation featuring SEGA and subsidiary company Atlus, which will also share floor space.
E3 2016 will take place between June 14 – 16. Do you think SEGA will share some unannounced surprises at this event? Let us know in the comments below!
