Wolff has begun discussions with Rosberg's representative Gerhard Berger to try to frame a new contract for the German driver, whose current deal runs out at the end of the year.
It is believed that there are differences of opinion about key terms, which include money and the potential length of the new deal.
Although both parties are eager to continue in to 2017, there is no guarantee that a new deal will be put in place if such issues cannot be sorted.
However, despite there being the possibility of some big names being available if Mercedes elected to pursue other options, Wolff has made it clear that it will not approach anyone else until it knows exactly what is happening with Rosberg.
"We want to continue with Nico and he wants to continue with us," Wolff said in the paddock at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on Friday.
"We are having discussions that are ongoing and very positive. We are not talking to anybody else. This is a commitment we owe to him.
"He has been part of the journey since 2010 and I am very optimistic that we will come to a solution soon."
Rosberg elected to appoint Berger to handle his talks because he did not want to get dragged in to intense discussions when he was battling for the world championship.
Wolff said that having Berger involved made sense for Rosberg and said that he was a good choice.
The pair were spotted in talks in the Montreal paddock shortly before second practice at the Canadian GP.
Wolff added: "Gerhard represents Nico because Nico didn't want to be diluted from his racing, and Gerhard can represent him well
"I've known Gerhard for ages and Niki knows him very well so it is good."
