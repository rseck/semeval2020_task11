"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I --
I took the one less travelled by, that let me explode a Supermutant's head with my bare hands
The aim is to create a character who specializes in skills rather than just stats -- you can't get all the perks in a given Special category just by maxing out that stat.
No level requirements -- perk ranks are unlocked through Special stats and dependency on other perks.
Perks are interdependent in a logical way, and some planning must go into how you want your character to develop.
June 14: Version 2.0. If you noticed the file earlier and decided to track it instead of download yet, this is the version you've probably been waiting for.
* Every single perk should have some requirements attached now. Depending on the perk, advancement in perk rank will depend on what other perks you have or don't have, and/or on Special stat. Some higher-rank perks may require a different Special stat than lower ranks -- e.g., Inspirational, a Tactician Path perk, advances through higher Perception until rank three, which requires Charisma as in the base game.
* Added stat and perk requirements to many of the top and bottom rung perks so you progress through them at a more reasonable pace; some bugfixes
* Added optional perk poster which marks off the paths and the "unlock" perks
A roleplaying overhaul of the Fallout 4 perk system giving you a greater feeling of progression in your chosen skill-sets.Perk Paths arranges every perk from the level-up poster into a series of paths. Each SPECIAL stat has at least two paths under it -- unlock the first perk in each path to continue progressing down it. Choosing some perks or paths locks you out of others, or at least cuts you off from further progress, and other perks or paths synergise well together.For example, Rooted and Moving Target are mutually exclusive at higher levels, but each can benefit a melee- or unarmed-focused character in different ways. Do you want to stand your ground and wait for your enemy to come to you, or do you want to take a screaming, bloody-minded run at them?The perks have literally been rearranged -- The top couple "floors" of the poster contain the perks needed to unlock each column.The actual effects of the perks aren't very different, though that will likely change in future updates, and the crafting benches -- chems, weapons, etc. -- have been moved under the Tinkerer path. Many of the perks, at least at the first level, aren't dependent on Special stat to unlock. I'll probably do some fine-tuning of this over time.Here's a snapshot of the paths (you may need to right-click, view image to see the full thing, or just click here ).Thestat is represented by, which focuses on hand-to-hand and melee fighting, and, which focuses on heavy guns.is represented by theandpaths -- the former focuses on scrapping and crafting, and the latter on fighting smarter rather than harder. Note that Locksmith has been moved under Tinkerer, though the perk can also be unlocked by stealth-related skills, and that Inspirational is under Tactician, though Local Leader is needed to advance it past the first level.is represented by theandpaths. Survivor focuses on staying alive by any means necessary and Dynamo on channeling your energy constructively (or destructively, if you ask your enemies).is represented by, which is all about having a strong personality that you can assert over others, and, which is about being more friendly and peaceable.Thepaths are, who has chemist and medical skills, and, who has computer, scientific and robotic skills.is represented by theandpaths. Spook skills are incompatible with Bruiser skills, so starting either path locks the other out. Duelist and Marksman are also mutually exclusive -- one focuses on wading into a crowd and quickly dispatching your foes, and the other on keeping your distance and hammering away at them through a scope.Andis represented byperks, which frankly didn't fit anywhere else, andperks, which rely falling ass-backwards into good fortune.A couple notes first:This is a work in progress, so I welcome feedback on what you think works, what doesn't, and what else you'd like to see.It should also go without saying that a new game is a must for this to work.Known issues? Rearranging the perks left a few of the icons in slightly strange positions for some reason, so not all the columns line up exactly straight. Hopefully I can fix this in a later update.Conflicts? Anything else that touches the perks from the poster or the requirements for the crafting benches.You can install manually or try it with NMM, which I don't use so I can't vouch for. This file contains only perkpaths.esp, so make sure that ends up in the Data folder and that it's enabled with your favorite mod tool and you're all set.------------------Delta Wasteland Radio for FO4http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11087/?Caps and Masks for FO4http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8836/?Classic Bomber Jacket for FO4http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8193/?The Driver's Jacket for FO4http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8508/?A Sackful of Hats for Fallout: New Vegashttp://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58540/?
