Supporters of a major overhaul of Hance Park in downtown Phoenix shared their final update during a city meeting last week. While some say it’s important for the city to stay focused on downtown development, not everyone is sold on the massive makeover.
The Hance Park Master Plan calls for dividing the downtown park into three zones, with the first phase focused along Central Avenue near Burton Barr Central Library. The park straddles Central Avenue between 3rd Street to the East and 5th Avenue to the West.
Consultant Phil Weddle told the Phoenix Parks Subcommittee that it will feature a skate park, a restaurant and an iconic feature called ‘The Cloud' which, “creates a gateway into downtown as well a gateway into the park and shades the plaza surrounding the Central Avenue area.”
Other phases for the 32-acre park call for a zipline, splash pad, bike lanes and multiple gardens. Full buildout is expected to take six years and cost nearly $120 million, something Councilman Jim Waring says is not "sellable."
“It’s $118 million and we can’t pay our bills without a tax increase now," he said.
Other councilmembers say Phoenix needs a signature urban park and support the idea of a public-private partnership. The Hance Park Conservancy, a nonprofit group pushing the plan, is working to find private partners to help make it happen.
