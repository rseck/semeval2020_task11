Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho set to play the Pope in new animated film about Fatima
Jose Mourinho is set to play the Pope in a new animated film.
The Special One was confirmed as Manchester United boss last week after agreeing to replace Louis van Gaal.
He will already be getting to work on his Old Trafford plans - but the Portuguese already has a new role.
Mourinho has been chosen to be the voice of Pope Francis in Portuguese, English, Spanish and Italian in the movie.
The film, called Fe, is being made to mark the 100th anniversay of the apparitions of the Virgin Mary to shepherd three children in Fatima.

It is scheduled to premiere on May 13 in 2017 with Mourinho's selection approved by the Vatican, according to reports in Portugal.
Mourinho is expected to donate his fee from the film to a charity for underprivileged kids.
No-one from Gestifute, the Portuguese firm of Mourinho’s agent Jorge Mendes, was immediately available for comment on Thursday.
Rui Pedro Oliveira, who signed Mourinho for the voiceover on behalf of production company Imagineview, said he took up the offer “without reticence or demands.”
