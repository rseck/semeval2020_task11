#ForTheLoveOfLIVE is an awareness campaign to bring attention to the damage COVID-19 shutdowns have caused Canada’s live music industry – the artists, festivals, venues, promoters, clubs, concert halls, arenas, talent agencies, unions and many others working in the supply chain that connect Canadians with extraordinary live music experiences.
We know how much live music means to you and we encourage you to join us and add your voice to support your favourite artists, local venues, friends, families and neighbours working in the live music industry. Make some noise!
