Florida added to their 2019 recruiting class with the addition of Largo (Fla.) defensive lineman Jaquaze Sorrells on Friday night. The 6-foot-3, 240-pound prospect landed an offer from the Gators after an impressive camp performance and committed immediately.
Sorrells now joins New Smyrna Beach (Fla.) cornerback Jaleel McRae as the two early members of Florida's 2019 class.
