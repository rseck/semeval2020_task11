The Debian project is pleased to announce the fifth update of its stable distribution Debian 8 (codename jessie ). This update mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable release, along with a few adjustments for serious problems. Security advisories were already published separately and are referenced where available.
Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian 8 but only updates some of the packages included. There is no need to throw away old jessie CDs or DVDs but only to update via an up-to-date Debian mirror after an installation, to cause any out of date packages to be updated.
Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org are included in this update.
New installation media and CD and DVD images containing updated packages will be available soon at the regular locations.
Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the aptitude (or apt) package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to one of Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive list of mirrors is available at:

This revision adds the following security updates to the stable release. The Security Team has already released an advisory for each of these updates:
The following packages were removed due to circumstances beyond our control:
Package Reason lyz Depends on to-be-removed zotero-standalone-build mediawiki No longer security supported mediawiki-math Depends on to-be-removed mediawiki zotero-standalone-build Unusable in jessie
The removal of mediawiki renders the "fusionforge-full" metapackage uninstallable in jessie. This issue was unfortunately not noticed in time to fix it as part of the point release, but will be resolved via jessie-updates soon.The installer has been updated to include the fixes incorporated into stable by the point release.
