Andrew Wiggins will not play for Canada in July for their Olympics qualification tournament.
Wiggins is set to start his third NBA season with the Minnesota Timberwolves.
"After much thought, consideration and speaking with my family, I will not be participating in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament with the Canadian Men's National Team in July," wrote Wiggins in a statement. "As my third NBA season approaches, I understand my increased role with the Timberwolves and dedication to the upcoming season must have my total focus. We are building a championship contending team, which has always been my goal. This was definitely not an easy decision and I fully support and wish Team Canada nothing but success this summer."
