Clinton Morrison took 36 games to get off the mark for Exeter City but, when it came in October 2015, he labelled his overhead kick against Stevenage as the best goal of his career
Clinton Morrison has returned to the Midlands to sign for Southern Premier League side Redditch United.
The 37-year-old Tooting-born former Crystal Palace, Birmingham City and Republic of Ireland striker was released at the end of the season by League Two club Exeter City.
Morrison scored more than 150 goals in his 18 years in league football, as well as nine in 36 internationals.
But he scored just one league goal in 17 months with the Grecians.
He has now been picked up by a Redditch side operating at the seventh tier of English football, led by former Aston Villa and Walsall striker Darren Byfield.
Nottingham-based Morrison said that the key motivation behind his move is the his friendship with Byfield, who left Solihull Moors to take over as Redditch boss last month when previous manager Liam McDonald left for Hednesford.
"I'm only doing this for Darren," Morrison told BBC Hereford & Worcester. "I don't need the money. I'm totally motivated. I've come to try and win things. I've not come here just for a jolly-up."
Morrison's last goal for Exeter came in the 3-0 FA Cup win over Didcot Town on 8 November
Redditch have been at this level of English football since being relegated from Conference North to the Southern Premier in 2011, following financial troubles.
They lie a division below neighbours Kidderminster Harriers and one above reformed Hereford FC. But, as part of a Â£900,000 redevelopment, they have laid down a 3G plastic pitch.
Morrison becomes their fourth signing in 24 hours following the signing of former Harriers defender Duane Courtney and the return of Reds pair Jamie Spencer and Jordan Jones to their home-town club.
