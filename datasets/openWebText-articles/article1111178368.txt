As it turns out, there really is one American city that's better than the others for the summer months -- and there's finally proof. Wakefield Research found that the four most popular attractions for summer getaways were beaches, national parks, amusement parks, and historical landmarks - but those are the only clues you'll get so far. Alan Cunningham, director of marketing tactics at Travelocity, explains the reasoning behind the Travelocity Vacation Summer Index : "We wanted to look at data to help travellers find the best summer vacation destinations. Our team analyzed which of the 50 largest cities in the U.S. can deliver the most important factors for a good summer vacation - availability of the most-wanted attractions, probability of good weather and affordability of lodging for the summer months â€“ and we were pleased to see that both traditionally popular and lesser-known summer destinations made the list." So who made it to first place on this highly-coveted list? Without further ado...
beat out its competitors with an Attraction Score of 8 and a perfect score of 10 for Weather. With easy access to various beaches, national parks and amusement parks, and comfortable temperatures with low humidity and close to zero precipitation, LA definitely checks off. The only thing that prevented the city from sweeping all of Travelocity's categories was its slightly pricier hotels. With all the exciting things it has to offer, though, we're willing to chalk it up as worth it and book the next flight to LA. If Los Angeles isn't your thing but you're still looking for a getaway to the west coast (AKA best coast), other cities in California also made it on Travelocity's Top 10 List. Consider planning your next trip to San Diego, Oakland, or Fresno. You won't be disappointed!
