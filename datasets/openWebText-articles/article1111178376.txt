THERE will be events taking place across Britain this weekend to celebrate The Queen 's 90th birthday - but it seems the party spirit is lost among some Scots.
The monarch 's actual birthday is April 21, as she was born on that day in 1926, but she also has her own an 'official' birthday in June, which the current celebrations are set to mark.
However, while the bunting will be out in force in some parts of the country, a section of Scottish people are most definitely shunning the occasion - and having fun doing so.
Under the Twitter trend #ScottishStreetParty, tongue in cheek posts have been shared showing how they are bringing in the milestone.
With photos of scenes including deserted streets, lone crisp packets and empty pubs, the subject has racked up more than 18,000 tweets , with users revelling in each other's banter.
Even some famous faces are lapping it up, with champion swimmer Michael Jamieson saying he was "cracking up reading the #ScottishStreetParty tweets."
And one user summed up the feelings of dozens of others, saying: "Police Scotland 'utterly unable to locate revellers' after multiple hoax ScottishStreetParty reports."
