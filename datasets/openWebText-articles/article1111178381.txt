The E3 suspense is getting higher now as a NeoGAF user has shared a link that a Swiss retailer, Alcom has listed Crash Bandicoot for PlayStation 4. Now, we have no clue if this could be a remake or a pure new Crash Bandicoot. The listing doesn’t explain much but show the game.
Crash Bandicoot coming to PlayStation 4 has always been a rumor and Sony executives have teased it on their shirts at conferences, but Sony has yet to say much on this. It now looks like Crash Bandicoot could be a big part of Sony’s E3.
