Florence Kasumba had only one line in Captain America: Civil War, but she nailed it. Marvel fans were so taken with her performance as Black Panther’s unnamed Security Chief that many have speculated she’ll appear again in the Black Panther movie as one of the members of the Dora Milaje, a group of Wakandan women who serve as Black Panther’s elite bodyguards. That’s still a possibility, of course, but before that, Florence Kasumba will be crossing over into the DC Cinematic Universe; she’s just secured herself a part in the Wonder Woman movie.
In Wonder Woman, Florence Kasumba will be taking on the role of Senator Acantha, one of the many Amazons of Themyscira. Although Senator Acantha has been a part of Wonder Woman history since issue #10, she is not exactly a well-known character, so it’s hard to say whether or not Kasumba will have many lines or whether she’ll be playing more of a background character.
We already know Kasumba can steal a scene even if she has only one line, but it would be nice to see her get more than one, especially considering that the preliminary photos of the Wonder Woman cast didn’t look as diverse as Themyscira normally looks in the comic books. For example, I’m hardly the first person to ask whether Phillipus will be making an appearance in Wonder Woman. Meanwhile, there’s Hessia, who is a relatively new character, but she’s one of the additions to the latter-day Wonder Woman comic books that I actually like. Historically, Themyscira has been a diverse place, so I’m hoping that the Wonder Woman movie will continue to reflect that.
What do you think about Florence Kasumba joining the Wonder Woman cast? Are you hoping to see her appear in Black Panther too? Personally, I’m hoping she can still do both!
