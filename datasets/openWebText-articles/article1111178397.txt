Thursday, we’re talking about the controversial career of Mormon historian Leonard Arrington. Arrington was the first professional head of LDS Church History, but his academic rigor and candor didn’t sit well with everyone in the hierarchy. Within a decade, he was removed from office and a number of scholars would eventually face Church discipline. Biographer Greg Prince joins Doug to explain how Arrington changed our understanding of Mormonism and how his legacy is felt in LDS scholarship today.
Greg Prince is an independent historian and co-author of David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism [Indiebound|Amazon]. His new book is called Leonard Arrington and the Writing of Mormon History [Indiebound|Amazon]
