It’s women’s history month so in this podcast episode, Luke hands over hosting duties to Niki Bossonis where she leads a discussion with a few Cyngn women: Emily McNamara, Ashley Hemingway, and Azalea Phangsoa. It’s a frank conversation about the gender pay gap, how assertive women are allowed to be in the workplace, and what makes them hopeful about how corporate America is changing.
