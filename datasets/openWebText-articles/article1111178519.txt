On Saturday, Kanye West's new Yeezy Boost 750 will drop. The hype is about to get insane for the latest release, but it's an entirely new Yeezy that's stealing the spotlight today. Though there have been only three silhouettes released under the Adidas Originals x Kanye West umbrella—the low-top 350, the aforementioned 750, and the duck boot 950—what's being dubbed as the 550 has been spotted on West himself in recent months. Now there are high-res photos (courtesy of Sneaker News) of the rumored sneakers, kicking the anticipation for them into high gear.
While Adidas hasn't so much as confirmed their existence (and, speaking of confirmed: Adidas, that sneaker-reservation app of yours is far from perfect), the fact that West has worn the black mid-tops is about as much validation as one could hope for at this point.
What makes these different from the 350s? For one, they seem to be cut slightly higher on the ankle. Additionally, unlike previous versions, they appear to be constructed of the super-cozy Adidas Primeknit upper, which means these will be even sock-ier than the 350s. And where the 350s feature an all-over pattern, these 550s are a solid tone with a lightning bolt–ish white stripe across the lateral side. Regardless of how they look, though (let's be real, Kanye could put out a line of literal bricks with laces and people would cop them), it's exciting that the Yeezy Boost family is growing.
