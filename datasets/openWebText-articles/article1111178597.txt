A Vancouver fishmonger landed a jumbo-sized fine for his role in the illegal trade in spot prawns.
Ying Chiu, the operator of Jumbo Seafood Co., was fined $30,000 last month in provincial court after pleading guilty to two counts of purchasing prawns caught out of season in January and February of 2014.
The commercial spot prawn season normally opens for May and June, according to officials with Fisheries and Oceans Canada.
The charge was part of a major investigation launched by Fisheries and Oceans Canada into the illegal harvesting and sale of both crabs and spot prawns.
The crackdown led to 38 charges being laid against two businesses and seven individuals.
The remaining charges against Chiu were stayed but charges against several other defendants are still underway.
According to court records some of the illegal fishing took place near Passage Island near the entrance to Howe Sound.
