Hillary Clinton becoming the presumptive presidential nominee of a major political party is a “truly historic moment” every American should celebrate, Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday.
Clinton celebrated the milestone Tuesday after a win in New Jersey thrust her over the 2,383-delegate mark, which The Associated Press said Clinton had reached Monday evening.
“As a father of two daughters, I’m proud,” Kerry told reporters Wednesday as he traveled to the United Arab Emirates from China, according to a Reuters report. “She’ll make a terrific president.”
