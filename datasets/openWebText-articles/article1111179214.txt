ISIS call for West to be targeted during Ramadan
A hateful Isis audio recording has asked followers to prepare for terror attacks over the month of Ramadan in Europe and the US.
In the audio message, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani asked jihadists to prepare for ‘a month of calamity everywhere for non-believers’.
But the recording made no mention of the EgyptAir flight 804 tragedy – which the extremist group has not claimed responsibility for.
Al-Adnani said: ‘Get prepared, be ready… to make it a month of calamity everywhere for the non-believers.

‘The message adds: “Especially for the fighters and supporters of the caliphate in Europe and America.
‘The smallest action you do in their heartland is better. If one of you hoped to reach the Islamic State, we wish we were in your place to punish the Crusaders day and night.’
The 31-minute message, posted on Saturday night, is called ‘That They Live By Proof’ and was released by the Al-Furqan media unit.
Al-Adnani asks supporters to target the west during the holy month, which starts June 7.

The recording also confirmed that ISIS ‘minister of war’, Abu Omar al-Shishani, was killed in a US airstrike.
Al-Adnani is considered the terror network’s most prominent public figure in Iraq. He has made several audio messages in the past.
The last audio recording issued by Isis was October last year.
Last night, the Iraqi government said troops were ‘approaching a moment of great victory’ against Isis fighters.
