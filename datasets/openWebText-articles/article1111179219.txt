Over at CBS Sports, Pete Prisco published his annual list of top 100 NFL players. Prisco listed two Tampa Bay Buccaneers on the list: Gerald McCoy at number 26, and Doug Martin at number 96. No Mike Evans, no Jameis Winston and, most shockingly, no Lavonte David.
McCoy's play slipped off some last season from 2014, but he is still one of the better inside players. He had 8.5 sacks last season, but his run play wasn't as good as in years past. Then again, he didn't have as much help around him.
At number 96, Prisco lists Doug Martin. That's a little low for the second-most productive back in the league, but he did have two pretty bad seasons in 2013 and 2014.
He had a resurgent season in 2015, finishing second in the league in rushing. That earned him a long-term deal from the Bucs this spring.
Shockingly, Prisco omitted Lavonte David. He didn't have the best season in his career, and had some downright bad games early in the season, but looking at the year as whole he certainly played very well. Certainly his peers thought so: they named him as the 53rd best player in the NFL on NFL Network's Top 100 players of 2015. A low ranking would be justified, but omitting him entirely is absurd.
