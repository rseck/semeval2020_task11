Start with two decks of cards: CHARACTERS (white cards) and ATTRIBUTES (black cards). Invariably your cards will be all mixed up so go ahead and sort that out.
One player starts by drawing three white cards and three black cards and keeps them, like his/her nonsense opinions, to him/herself. A second player does the same.
