It’s been nearly three years since Haim released their debut LP Days Are Gone in September 2013. The trio have now given an update on their sophomore album, which they hope to finish in time for an autumn release. In an interview with Rolling Stone, they revealed that work began when they were asked to write a song for a film. That turned into a new track called “Little of Your Love,” which will be on the upcoming LP. From there, the Haims said they wrote over 12 songs, including one called “Nothing’s Wrong.” All the songs, they said, were written in their parents’ L.A. living room. After writing, the band headed to Days Are Gone producer Ariel Rechtshaid’s studio to record new music, which they were doing as of late April. Danielle Haim added that they also recorded with ex-Vampire Weekend member Rostam Batmanglij. She said, “Rostam is very fast and we work very quickly and spur-of-the-moment with him.” Check out the whole interview here.
