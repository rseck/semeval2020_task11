/r/news is preventing intelligent discussion and debate by censoring content, deleting comments and muting users. The mods of the /r/news abuse their power as Reddit moderators exhibiting poor political agendas. For example, on 12 June 2016, the news reported a mass shooting at a night club in Orlando, Florida. Simply because of the shooters ethnicity, the /r/news mods went crazy and started muting/deleting and locking threads, comments and reddit users who were simply trying to discuss (seen here - https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4nqaik/omar_mateen_orlando_gay_club_shooter_identified/ . On the same hand, the mods of /r/news allowed all posts and discussion of the Charleston South Carolina. (as seen here - https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3a8k4r/breaking_active_shooting_downtown_charleston/
The /r/news mods have exhibited racist viewpoints and allow unfair, uneven, agenda related choices.
The purpose of this petition is to either disband all new mods and get new ones or prevent them from censoring the things they don't like caused by their own favoritism instead of allowing discussion.
