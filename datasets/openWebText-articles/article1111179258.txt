Mitt Romney, the twice-failed Republican candidate for president, has kicked off a weekend convention of fellow-minded "NeverTrump-ers," hosting a retreat at a secluded Utah spot so they can gather and talk without worry of media coverage and condemnation about how they should proceed politically, if the billionaire businessman wins the White House.
It's called the "Experts and Enthusiasts Summit," or "E2" summit, and it's set at the Stein Eriksen Lodge Deer Valley in Park City, the Washington Post reported.

But Kristol's top pick, National Review writer David French, opted against a run, sending the "NeverTrump" crowd back to square one.
