Here is a rare mid-1960s Kawai S4T electric guitar. This is the same model favored by the late great Hound Dog Taylor. Surviving examples of this model are few and far between. This particular guitar is a fine example:
• Original whammy bar included (off at present because I don't use it)
The guitars Taylor used were a big part of his awesome skanky sound. This example, through a cranked tube amp, nails the hollow, scratchy, lo-fi howl you hear on the recordings. These guitars were cheap 50 years ago - when they were new - and most of them probably ended up in the dumpster or pawn shops. So ironically, they’re mighty rare today, especially in great condition like this one. I wager there are 100 beautiful vintage 1960s Gibsons or Fenders for each Kawai Hound Dog Taylor model still in existence. “As it should be!” you say??? Well, if you want the skronky, snotty, distorted tone Taylor had, you’ll never squeeze it out of your Gibson, or Fender, or boutique amp, and no distortion pedal will get you close. This tone is as rare as the guitar itself – no other guitar I’ve ever played can achieve what these can do, and that’s something to be treasured if you play electric blues or rock.
The only issue is that the binding on the bass side of the neck is missing - an easy fix.
